# onedrive-cli-api

This project offers python scripts that allow to modify the sharing profile and permissions of files and directories in your OneDrive directly from command line or through other scripts you can develope based on them and sistemizing your workflows.
This allows to authomatize these operations and to instantly change the permissins for all the interested students at the start of an exam, or in any other situation where appropriate timing or even just ease of use, precision, error-resiliency, and robustness might turn essential (let alone the important usage time savings for the operator).

A description (updated to november 2020) on how some of these operations can be performed by hand, through the standard GUI of OneDrive (as in november 2020) is contained in the file `getby.sharing_fatto_a_mano`.

Currently, we maintain two versions of our utility:

 1. share0.py:  this is the first version developed by Marco Fattorelli (also available to its GitHub repo: https://github.com/marcofattorelli/python-onedrive-api/)

 2. share.py:  this is a more recent version developed by Davide Roznowicz in order to overcome some platform dependent issues.

## Setup

In the doc folder you find instructions on how to set up tokens and permissions for your OneDrive account so that our scripts can work and export their basic functionalities.

## Usage in action
